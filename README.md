GROUP TOKSU TIC TAC TOE

In this project, we will rebuild the Tic Tac Toe Game using the STM32F401 microcontroller, utilizing an interactive approach where LED indicators represent the players instead of using traditional X and O markers. The green LED will represent Player 1, while the red LED will represent Player 2. The STM32F401 will handle the game logic, display, and user input, providing an excellent opportunity to learn about embedded systems, GPIO control, and simple game mechanics.
The game will use a 3x3 grid, represented by 9 buttons. Each button corresponds to a cell in the Tic Tac Toe grid (labeled from 1 to 9). Players will take turns pressing one of the 9 buttons to place their respective LED color in the grid. Player 1 will be represented by a green LED, and Player 2 by a red LED. The STM32F401 microcontroller will process the button inputs and update the game state accordingly.
The game begins with an empty grid, with all LEDs off. Player 1 will press one of the 9 buttons, and the corresponding grid cell will light up with a green LED. Then, Player 2 will press another button, and the corresponding cell will light up with a red LED. The game alternates between the two players, with each pressing a button to mark their position on the grid. After each turn, the microcontroller will check if any player has won. The winning conditions are: Three LEDs of the same color in a row, column, or diagonal. If a player achieves this, the game will announce the winner. If all 9 positions are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
There are 9 buttons that will be used to represent the 9 positions in the Tic Tac Toe grid, corresponding to the numbers 1 through 9. Each button is connected to a GPIO pin, which the STM32F401 will monitor for player input. The LED grid will consist of 9 LEDs, each associated with a grid position. The LEDs will be lit in green or red depending on which player occupies the respective position. A Reset button will allow the players to restart the game. This button will clear the LEDs and reset the grid, allowing the game to begin again.
After a player wins or the game results in a tie, the STM32F401 will display the gameâ€™s end state and wait for the Reset button to be pressed. Pressing the Reset button will turn off all LEDs, clear the game state, and return the game to its initial, empty grid state, allowing players to start a new game.
This project will not only help demonstrate the logic behind a simple yet fun game but also provide hands-on experience in working with embedded systems. The STM32F401 will manage button presses, update the game board, and check for winning conditions. The use of GPIO pins for button input and LED output, combined with basic game logic, will provide a great foundation in embedded development. By the end of the project, the result will be a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game that uses LEDs to represent players, providing a valuable learning experience in the world of microcontroller programming and embedded systems development.
